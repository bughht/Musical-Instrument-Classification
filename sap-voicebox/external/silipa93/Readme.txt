April 2008 (updated)

The SIL Encore IPA and SIL IPA93 fonts are obsolete, symbol-encoded fonts. 
Their use is discouraged. If you decide to download and use these fonts, 
please note there is no user support for these fonts.

Documentation files are located at C:\Program Files\SIL\Fonts\SILIPA93 or on the 
Start menu at Start / All Programs / SIL / Fonts / SILIPA93. Not all of the 
documentation files from the original package are included in the current
package as they are in a format incompatible with modern computers AND
because we expect people to only use these fonts for existing documents. If
you are creating new documents you should be using the 
Doulos SIL (https://scripts.sil.org/DoulosSILfont) or 
Charis SIL (https://scripts.sil.org/CharisSILfont) fonts which provide complete
IPA AND Unicode support.

Dear Linguist,

The enclosed files constitute the SIL Encore IPA93 Fonts. They are
provided in TrueType format only. Please read the accompanying 
documentation for more specific information on the fonts.

SIL International is an organization of linguists dedicated to the 
study and promotion of the thousands of minority languages around 
the world. International Publishing Services serves SIL by developing 
products to assist in the publication of linguistic texts.

We are happy to make these IPA fonts available to the general
linguistic community at no charge. Please note that these fonts do 
not provide Unicode support. Their use is discouraged. The 
Doulos SIL (https://scripts.sil.org/DoulosSILfont) and 
Charis SIL (https://scripts.sil.org/CharisSILfont) fonts do provide 
Unicode IPA support. However, you must convert existing data using 
the "SIL IPA93 Fonts" to Unicode before using the Doulos SIL or 
Charis SIL font. 

You may share these fonts with your friends
and co-workers, but with the following restrictions:

	* All files must be copied together, including this one.
	* No fee may be charged for the fonts

Even though these fonts are "free", SIL retains all copyright and
ownership of the included fonts and reserves the right to restrict
their use and distribution at any time. They may not be used as a
basis for other fonts. They may be placed on bulletin boards, etc.
but cannot be included in (or bundled with) any commercial product
including hard disks or CD-ROMs without specific written permission.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT

The SIL Encore IPA and SIL IPA93 fonts are obsolete, symbol-encoded fonts. 
Their use is discouraged. If you decide to download and use these fonts, 
please note there is no user support for these fonts.

These fonts are intended for use by experienced computer users. Installing 
and using these fonts is not a trivial matter. The most effective technical 
support is usually provided by an experienced computer user who can 
personally sit down with you at your computer to troubleshoot the problem.

If you are having difficulty, be sure to do the following:

    * Carefully read all the documentation provided with the fonts, 
      including the documentation installed by the installation program.
    * Check out all the links on the web pages for these font packages, 
      and read all the information and instructions they contain.

INSTALLING IN WINDOWS

The SIL IPA93 Fonts 2.0 package automatically installs
the TrueType fonts and documentation when accessed through Microsoft Windows.

While in Explorer select the drive icon where the SILIPA93.EXE file 
is located. Find SILIPA93.EXE in the directory window and double-click on it.

If you downloaded the fonts from the Internet, then you will select the 
drive:\directory where you placed the file SILIPA93.EXE.

Example:  C:\DOWNLOAD\SILIPA93.EXE

In this case, the file was placed in the \DOWNLOAD directory on
drive C. (Select the actual drive and directory where you placed your
files.)

If the SILIPA93.EXE file is located on a CD

Example:  D:\SILIPA93.EXE

then select drive D:. In this case, the fonts are being installed from drive D.

After double-clicking on SILIPA93.EXE follow the instructions and respond to the dialog
boxes.

Once the font and documentation are installed you can access the documentation
from Start / All Programs / SIL / Fonts / SILIPA93.


          CHANGES FOR VERSION 1.20

***Linking Character***

Character 237 in the original (1.0) IPA fonts was a non-spacing
diacritic. This really should have been a spacing character. Although
the IPA calls that character a "Bottom Tie Bar" (analogous to the Top
one in code 131), it signifies "Linking (absence of a break)" and is
used to link two sounds that are written with a space between them.
Hence, these fonts have 237 as a spacing character.


***Doulos Character Spacing***

After a number of comments from users, we have "relaxed" the spacing
of the SILDoulosIPA font to conform to that of the SILDoulos fonts in
the SIL Encore Fonts. This means that there will be more spacing
between the characters, making the text easier to read. This also
means that texts set in the original SILDoulosIPA will have different
line breaks if opened on a computer with the new SILDoulosIPA. If you
have a strong reason to retain the original spacing, do not install
this new font. We do, however, recommend that you use this new font.


***Sophia Dieresis***

The three dieresis characters (45, 95, 208) in the SILSophiaIPA font
now have dots spaced further apart.


***Manuscript Space Width***

The space character in the SILManuscriptIPA font is now (reliably)
equal in width to the other characters.
